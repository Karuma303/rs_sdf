# About

A simple library to generate 2-dimensional 
[`Distance Fields`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance_transform) (DF) 
written in pure [`Rust`](https://www.rust-lang.org/) ü¶Ä

The lib can import PNG images, convert them into a 
distance field and export the distances as a PNG again.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
  
This project is not officially released yet. Its current status is pre-alpha and
every part of the lib is work in progress.  
Please note that this is my personal playground to learn the Rust programming 
language, so don't expect any highly sophisticated code samples here. 
I will try to improve this library over time, however right it is not recommended 
to use it for anything and especially not in production. üòâ

## Examples

| Input image| Outer dist. (8bit) | Inner dist. (8bit) |  
| --- | --- | --- |  
| <img alt="input image 1" src="examples/assets/example_2_rgba_512x512.png" width="200" height="200" /> | <img alt="outer distance 1" src="doc/images/odf_example_2_512x512.png" width="200" height="200" /> | <img alt="inner distance 1" src="doc/images/idf_example_2_512x512.png" width="200" height="200" />   

| Combined dist. (8bit) | 2-Channel (8bit) |    
| --- | --- |  
| <img alt="combined distance 4" src="doc/images/cdf_example_2_512x512.png" width="200" height="200" /> | <img alt="two channel output" src="doc/images/cdf_example_2_512x512_2_channel.png" width="200" height="200" /> |  

| Random dots  | Regular dots  |   
| --- | --- |  
| <img alt="random dots" src="doc/images/cdf_example_7_512x512.png" width="200" height="200" /> | <img alt="regular dots" src="doc/images/cdf_example_8_512x512.png" width="200" height="200" /> |  


## TODO

## Fluent syntax

##### Current version
```rust
    let g : DistanceGenerator = DistanceGenerator::new()
        .input(PngInput::new("example/image.png"))
        .output(PngOutput::new("example/image_generated.png",
                               ImageOutputChannels::One,
                               ImageOutputChannelDepth::Eight))
        .export_filter(ExportFilter::Foreground)
        .processor(EightSideSweepProcessor {});

    let result = g.generate();
```

## Input
From ImageBuffer  
From File (File -> ImageBuffer)  
From TTF Font File  
Additional Transformers would be nice too:
Rotate, Flip, B/W, ChannelMatrix (Re-Map Channels), Threshold,
scale (up/down) <- very important ... inc. linear/bi-linear/tri-linear interpolation
Bits per channel Channel (1/8/16/32/64) (Source format) - 
But how do we calculate the output? ->  B/W vs. Greyscale

## Output  
ImageBuffer
File (just a special transformation of an ImageBuffers. Which channels do we use?   
8/16/32 Bit?  
Int or Float?  
Even here we have the options to do multiple transformations (scale, rotate, flip)  


## Configuration  
Used Algorithm (Naive, 8SED, Dead Reckoning, etc.)

In theory it should be possible to apply this to TTF Fonts. For that, we should have an CLI executable
that should be configurable (used glyphs etc)  
SDFs of the glyphs should be packed in some way to a texture atlas. What about hinting?

A good inspirational source is TextMeshPro!

Is there any known file format for SDF Fonts?
