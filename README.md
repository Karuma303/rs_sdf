# About

A simple library to generate 2-dimensional 
[Distance Fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance_transform) (DF) 
written in pure [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) ðŸ¦€

The lib can import PNG images, convert them into a 
distance field and export the distances as a PNG again.

## Disclaimer
  
Please note that this is my personal playground to learn the Rust programming 
language, so don't expect any highly sophisticated code samples here. 
I will try to improve this library over time, however right now the whole repo
is WIP and it is not recommended to use it for anything 
and especially not in production. ðŸ˜‰

## Examples

| Input image| Outer dist. (8bit) | Inner dist. (8bit) |  
| --- | --- | --- |  
| <img alt="input image 1" src="doc/images/example_2_rgba_512x512.png" width="200" height="200" /> | <img alt="outer distance 1" src="output/odf_example_2_512x512.png" width="200" height="200" /> | <img alt="inner distance 1" src="output/idf_example_2_512x512.png" width="200" height="200" />   

| Combined dist. (8bit) | 2-Channel (8bit) |    
| --- | --- |  
| <img alt="combined distance 4" src="output/cdf_example_2_512x512.png" width="200" height="200" /> | <img alt="two channel output" src="output/cdf_example_2_512x512_2_channel.png" width="200" height="200" /> |  

| Random dots  | Regular dots  |   
| --- | --- |  
| <img alt="random dots" src="output/cdf_example_7_512x512.png" width="200" height="200" /> | <img alt="regular dots" src="output/cdf_example_8_512x512.png" width="200" height="200" /> |  


## TODO

- [x] Simple prototype with image input and output  
- [X] SourceProcessor trait  
- [X] Two-channel image output 
- [ ] Project structure (modules, libs, crates, features, examples...)

## Fluent syntax

##### Current version
```rust
let gen = DistanceGenerator::new()
            .input("/path")
            .output("/path")
            .generate();

    let gen = DistanceGenerator::new()
        .input("/input/file/path.png")
        .output(PngOutput::new("/output/file/path.png",
                               ImageOutputChannels::Two,
                               ImageOutputChannelDepth::Eight))
        .export_type(ExportType::UnsignedInnerOuterDistance)
        .processor(EightSideSweepProcessor{})
        .generate();
```

## Input
From ImageBuffer  
From File (File -> ImageBuffer)  
From TTF Font File  
Additional Transformers would be nice too:
Rotate, Flip, B/W, ChannelMatrix (Re-Map Channels), Threshold,
scale (up/down) <- very important ... inc. linear/bi-linear/tri-linear interpolation
Bits per channel Channel (1/8/16/32/64) (Source format) - 
But how do we calculate the output? ->  B/W vs. Greyscale

## Output  
ImageBuffer
File (just a special transformation of an ImageBuffers. Which channels do we use?   
8/16/32 Bit?  
Int or Float?  
Even here we have the options to do multiple transformations (scale, rotate, flip)  


## Configuration  
Used Algorithm (Naive, 8SED, Dead Reckoning, etc.)

In theory it should be possible to apply this to TTF Fonts. For that, we should have an CLI executable
that should be configurable (used glyphs etc)  
SDFs of the glyphs should be packed in some way to a texture atlas. What about hinting?

A good inspirational source is TextMeshPro!

Is there any known file format for SDF Fonts?
